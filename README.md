I am **Vinay** [38], a data science practitioner living in  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/206/206615.png" width="13"/> **Den Bosch, Netherlands**. Originally from <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/206/206606.png" width="13"/> India, I have moved around a lot in my growing years and spent the last decade in <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/555/555538.png" width="13"/> Singapore. I have worked across multiple domains and picked up various skills that can't be grouped under a single role like a data scientist or data engineer or ML engineer. So I think of myself as the data guy who can work across various stages of AI applications, from research to deployment. Trying to streamline myself a bit more now to pursue projects where my skillset (NLP/ML/DL) or passion (football analytics) find utility. **Welcome to my github profile**!  

🔭 I’m currently working as a ML/Data engineer in the domain of large commercial vehicle trading at [BAS World](https://www.basworld.com/).  
👯 I’m also interested in collaborating on ⚽📈football analytics related projects. Check my last work: a package out for plotting tracking/event data - [_pitchly_](https://github.com/opunsoars/pitchly)!

⚡ Fun fact: Love puns (and word games and crosswords). _o.pun.soars_ is a pun on `open source` (in case you were wondering)
